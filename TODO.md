# Dragon's Lair RPG - TODO List

## üéØ Current Status: 100% Complete Modularization

The project has been successfully modularized from a 5523-line monolithic file into a clean, organized structure. All major issues have been resolved:

### ‚úÖ RECENTLY FIXED ISSUES:

- **DarkKnight Entity**: Created dark knight entity with black armor, red accents, and dark dragon helmet flares
- **Guard Entity**: Extracted original detailed dragon knight guard with complete armor, helmet, sword, and shield
- **Boss System**: Extracted all boss fight conditions, tracking, and logic to dedicated system module
- **Documentation Enhancement**: Added novice-friendly explanations and detailed comments to all key files
- **Item Drawing**: Fixed proper animations and details for health/mana items with pulse and float effects
- **Enemy Drawing**: Fixed detailed enemy graphics with proper animations, effects, and health bars
